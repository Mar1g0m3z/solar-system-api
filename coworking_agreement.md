# Coworking Agreement

T: Talk through each section with your partner. Add notes on what you discussed and agreed upon in each section. At the bottom, type your names to sign off on your agreement.
S:
## Accessibility Needs
*What does each team member need access to in order to succeed and show up the best they can?*
T: time to read through instructions, and understanding before jumping in. 
M: I like when people explain concept and how they work through their code. It helps me understand different thought processes, and allows me to also learn how to atriculate why wrote my code. 


## Collaboration vs. individual work expectations
*Clarify your collaboration expectations- does your group want to write code together all of the time? Or divide work to do independently, then come together to share accomplishments? What tools and technologies can help your collaboration?*
T: We are able to work on our assignment, complete with no problem. If we have to work on it outside of class, we would message each other on class, suggestions on our code, within reasonable hours. 

S: I am not picky with which method to go with, if its nav or driver, or working at the same time. I can go with whatever is most comfortable with the other person. And if need be, I can split work when we don't have time in class.
## Learning Style
*How does each team member learn best in project settings?*
T: Mix of watching and listening. 
S: I like to have hands on learning, and talking it out, it think helps me retain more information.

## Preferred Feedback Style
*How does each team member best receive feedback?*
T: We switched between Nav and Driver, but looking at code at the same time is good! 
Talk about improvements and suggestions, find different ways to work on the code 

S: I don't mind when a teammember pauses to correct or to let me know their thought process, I also though, like positve feedback ("good job Sela, you get a sticker")

## One Team Communication Skill to Improve
*What is a teamwork-related skill you want to work on?*
T: One when we both understand what we are working on, each person understanding the concepts and code that we work on. 
S: Choosing my words carefully, making sure I use positive feedback to others, and able to make our working enviornment a safe space. 

## Optional: Other agreements
